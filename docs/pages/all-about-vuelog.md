title: All about Vuelog

### Why did I create Vuelog?

About one or two years ago, I migrated my blog to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I chose [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) to generate the static website (don't ask me anything about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), I just don't like it, for no reason).

Everytime I wrote something, I generated the whole site locally, and then pushed via git client. At the beginning I think, well, it is boring but I can stand it. However, one thing changed my mind recently - I got a new laptop. You know the dirty works to set up a work station. Hexo only pushed the generated site to GitHub, all the configurations and source markdown files are stored locally. Fortunately, I didn't format the old laptop before I realized I forgot to backup them.

Then I was wondering, can I put the configurations into the repository? Also, can I get rid of building the whole site all the time? A coder's answer is (always) to build my own wheels.

### Why did I choose Vue?

Why not Angular or React?

Angular is not an option because I use it quite a lot. I want to try something I haven't used before. 

[Vue](http://vuejs.org/) is my first option without a doubt, you can tell it from the project's name. Besides a well designed core library, Vue has a complete toolkit for developement, including scaffolding tool ([vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli)), client-side routing ([vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router)), centralized state management ([vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex)), client-side debugging tool ([vue-devtools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools)) and other useful tools.

Personally I like Vue more than React. I wrote several "toys" before but haven't got a chance for real deal. React also has its own ecosystem. Maybe I'll try it in my next project.

### Who can use Vuelog?

Anyone, as long as you are willing to write something more than 140 words (characters), and have a place (e.g. GitHub Pages) to host your writings.
